Description of Additional Report (Customer Schedule Report):

The additional report that I have chosen is the Customer Schedule Report. This report will generate a list of all the appointments by customer. There is a combo box with a list of customers to select. Whichever customer is selected, the table will display all of the selected customer's appointments. This gives you the ability to get reports of all appointments for each customer.
